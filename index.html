	 <p>
	 Today I will try to introduce myself so that you can get to know me better through this web site

    <h2>Travels</h2>
    <p>From a young age I have always had the chance to travel around the world. It then became one of my greatest passions.</p>
   </div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>Always looking for sensation and not knowing how to stay in place, I tried many sports before finding the one that suited me: gymnastics. </p>
    </div>

  <div> 
    <h2>Culinary arts</h2>
    <p>Driven by this desire to learn, I discovered a passion for food but more particularly for its preparation.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Family </h2>
    <p>Of course, it's impossible for me to introduce myself without talking about where I come from.  </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Friends</h2>
    <p>Like everything I've just presented, my friends are an integral part of my life for me: they define me as I am</p>
